        Jokester began sneaking into the castle in the middle of the night and
        leaving jokes all over the place: under the kings pillow, in his soup,
        even in the royal toilet. The king was furious, but he couldn t seem to
        stop Jokester. And then, one day, the people of the kingdom discovered
        that the jokes left by Jokester were so funny that they couldn t help
        but laugh. And once they started laughing, they couldn t stop.
